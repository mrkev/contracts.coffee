# note on combinators...racket provides a bunch of flat contracts
# like >, <, between, etc. The only one we're providing are 'and' and 'or'.
# I think the escape syntax is sufficient and potentially less confusing (also less
# work for me :-). So where racket would use the flat combinators we have:
f :: (Num and (!(x) -> x > 4)) -> (Num and (!(x) -> x < 10 and x > 1)
